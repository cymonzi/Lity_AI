- **Smart Fallbacks**: Enhanced responses even when the model isn't available
- **Seamless Integration**: Updated chatLogic.js to use your local model

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Model Files
- `lity-ai-final-model/` - Your trained DialoGPT model
- `local_model_server.py` - Flask server running your AI model
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### Model Specifications
- **Base Model**: microsoft/DialoGPT-small
- **Training Samples**: 36 financial conversations
- **Optimizations**: No LoRA, not quantized
- **Device**: Auto-detects CUDA/CPU

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Health check
- `POST /chat/` - Send messages to AI

## 🎯 Usage Tips

1. **First Run**: The model may take a moment to load initially
2. **Memory**: DialoGPT-small is lightweight and should run on most systems
3. **Responses**: The model generates contextual financial advice based on your training data
4. **Fallbacks**: If the model fails, smart fallback responses ensure the chat keeps working

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Model Server Won't Start
- Check Python installation: `python --version`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check port 5000 isn't in use

### Frontend Can't Connect
- Ensure model server is running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Restart both servers if needed

### Poor Model Responses
- The model was trained on 36 samples - responses improve with more training data
- Fallback responses handle topics outside the training scope
- Consider fine-tuning with additional data for better performance

## 📊 Performance

- **Startup Time**: ~10-30 seconds (depending on hardware)
- **Response Time**: ~1-3 seconds per message
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB-2GB (depending on device)
- **Training Data**: 36 SMK Moneykind financial conversations

## 🎉 Success!

Your Lity AI chatbot now uses your custom-trained model for more contextual and relevant financial conversations. The model understands SMK Moneykind terminology and provides tailored responses based on your training data.
